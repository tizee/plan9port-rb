# plan9port-rb

Why? The `homebrew-core` has removed `plan9port` (see [brew#6478] and [homebrew-core#38394]). So we cannot install with `brew install plan9port` anymore.

[brew#6478](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/6478)
[homebrew-core#38394](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/38394)

## Usage

```zsh
brew tap tizee/plan9port-rb
brew install plan9port
```
